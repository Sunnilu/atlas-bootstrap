My First Bootstrap, ALL BY MYSELL!

So what is this project about?  Well something that I spend a lot of time doing outside of school- bowling!

I decided to use a video, instead of an image, turns out I had to learn how to add a video file (MOV format) - working on a Bootstrap HTML-only project and the file is a video, you have to treat it as a background video instead of a static image. I did have to use CSS to to set the video as a background element within that container.
