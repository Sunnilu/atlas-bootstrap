My First Bootstrap, ALL BY MYSELL!

So what is this project about?  Well something that I spend a lot of time doing outside of school- sports!

I decided to use different pics of women in some of my favorite sports, with an emphasis on black women in sports.  I should have put golf in and bowling the two main sports that I participate in but anyway you get the point.

I started with the Bootstrap grid system to create a responsive design to adapt to different sceen sizes.

Each image is given classes img-fluid, rounded and shadow- it should scale properly and I was trying to give it some sort of visually appealing style.

I wrapped it in a div with the class container, (I took the easy way out) to center it on large screens.

from further reading, the rows and columns structure the proper alignment and spacing for my images.

My margin and padding, I used mt, margin top 5 and mb, margin bottom-5 to add vertical space between rows.

I used text centering which is just tect-center class to the paragraph to center it within the card.

I could have adjusted the font size or weight of the paragraph to make it stand out more by adding CSS-  I wanted to try the Bootstraps typography classes, but needed assistance.  So I guess we will see if I got help with that when you look at my HTML

I added the CDN which is said to be used for easy integration.

from looking at videos, it suggested that I use high quality images.  Theres something called lazy loading also for pages with many images, which improves initial page load time.
